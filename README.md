# Snake Game

## Description
Have fun eating food and growing your Pacman with the Snake game that is set up using Java.
I worked on this project to get more practice with Java and using JFrame which was completely new to me. I have a better understanding of it now and have some ideas for future projects.

I used .fillArc() to set the snake head to represent PacMan.

Future Work: 
  - Setting up a "Play Again" Button so that you can replay the game quickly instead of having to restart the program.
  - Adding images for the food cell.


## Setup
Simply clone this project and run the program on your IDE where Java is supported. I'm using IntelliJ.
